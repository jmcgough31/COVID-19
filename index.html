                U.S reported cases: <br />
                04/10/20 496,530 +8%<br />
                04/11/20 526,391 +6%<br />

                04/11/20 20,457 +10%<br />
                04/12/20 22,014 +8% <br />
                <br />
                Virginia reported cases:<br />
                04/10/20 4,509 +12%<br />
                04/11/20 5,077 +13%<br />
                04/12/20 5,274 +4% <br />
            </p>
            <p>Weekend predictions were pretty close.&nbsp; <br /> With just over 550,000 total cases. The U.S only saw
                a 5% growth yesterday. Leading to 6,000 fewer reported cases compered to Friday. I estimate we are very
                close to peek. We could be seeing the start of the peak for the U.S. now.&nbsp; If this downward trend
                continues by the end of the week could start to show consistent lower new case count indicating the
                peak.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
            <p>I was a little short on the number of deaths. I predicted 23,000 the U.S saw 22,000.&nbsp; which is a
                good thing. The growth rate for deaths dropped a little steeper than I had estimated, only showing 8% by
                the end of the weekend. unfortunately, the U.S. case fatality rate jumped slightly higher to 3.9%. I do
                estimate that the death growth rate will be 1-2 weeks behind new cases. Due to the average length of
                infection.</p>
            <p>Virginia Saw only 274 cases over my estimate of 5,000. VA only had 4% growth yesterday. However, like we
                have seen before, V.A.s numbers have been low after the weekend. Indicating delayed weekend
                reporting.&nbsp; I expect a slight jump tomorrow possibly into Wednesday.</p>
            <p>After a few weeks and establishing a trend it appears the 4-day prediction model I have created is
                somewhat accurate.</p>

                    U.S reported cases: 461,437 +8%<br />
                    U.S reported deaths: 16,478 +12%<br />
                    Virginia reported cases: 4,042 +11%<br />
                </p>
                <p>U.S. daily growth remains at a constant 8% for the third day in a row. We saw a similar leveling off
                    point (13%) last week at the same time then followed by a drop after the weekend.</p>
                <p>The U.S. daily growth death rate saw a small decrease from the previous day however still higher than
                    the new cases. Bringing the U.S. overall case fatality rate to 3.5%&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Virginia continues to display erratic daily growth numbers.&nbsp; This could be due to the smaller
                    sample size or delay reporting.&nbsp; Overall VA seems to be trending around 5 days behind the
                    national average.</p>
                <p>weekend predictions:&nbsp; Monday we could posable see over 550,000 total cases and 23,000 deaths for
                    the nation.&nbsp; In Virginia, we could see over 5,000 total cases. At the by end of next week I
                    hope to see the overall peak of new cases for the U.S.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>U.S. daily growth remains at 8%. The U.S. daily death growth rate saw a slight decrease from 18%
                        to 16%. Unfortunately, this number still remains significantly higher than the growth rate of
                        new cases. Leading to another increase in the U.S. case fatally rate. Now at 3.4%.&nbsp;&nbsp;
                        the lower growth of new cases and the larger death growth rate could be due to poor testing or
                        sampling bias. The U.S could be reducing testing on individuals with mild or no symptoms while
                        only testing those that come to the hospital with more severe symptoms. We could also be seeing
                        a sudden jump in severe cases leading more strain on the healthcare system in certain hotspots.
                    </p>
                    <p>The Virginia daily growth rate is down again to 9% more in line with the national average the
                        jump we saw yesterday could have been from delayed reporting from the weekend.</p>

                        </p>
                        <p>The U.S overall daily growth rate continues to drop slowly. We only saw 8% new cases
                            yesterday. This trend continues to follow the prediction that the U.S will hit peek mid to
                            end of April.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br /> <br /> The U.S did see a large spike in the daily death
                            growth rate. From 12% to 18%. Unfortunately, this jump brings the case fatality rate up to
                            3.2%</p>
                        <p>Virginia also saw a large jump in the daily growth rate 9% to 16% with 457 new case.&nbsp;
                            This could be due to delayer reporting.&nbsp; Virginia has had reported errors before.
                            Hopefully we will see a big drop tomorrow.&nbsp;</p>

                        </p>

                        <p>Today the downward daily growth trend continues in all the areas. </p>

                        <p>For reported cases the rate we see now is the lowest it has ever been at 9%.</p>

                        <p> The daily growth rate for deaths has also turned downward steeply from last week. Today we
                            only saw 12% compared to last week when the percentage was in the mid 20s. however the case
                            fatality rate to continues to tick slightly upward(2.9%) due to the higher death daily
                            growth rate. Still much lower than most of Europe.</p>

                        <p> Virginia is continuing to follow the same downward daily growth trend with only 9%. </p>

                        <p> There could be various factors driving this downward trend. Including more stay at home
                            orders / stricter social distancing rules. The U.S could be completing less testing, driving
                            the numbers down. The population could be developing herd immunity. Or the virus is starting
                            to reach its maximum carrying capacity. Either way. Letâ€™s hope the daily growth rate
                            continues to fall.</p>
