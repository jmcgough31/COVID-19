            <p>The U.S. continues its weekly climb up the wave as seen in past weeks.&nbsp; Today with daily growth of
                2.7% resulting in 27,100 new cases. 432 less cases than the same day last week. The weakly average of
                new cases is consistently showing lower than the previous weeks. Previous weeks new cases averages
                starting on April 5<sup>th</sup> 31,078, 29,401, 29,027, and the current week average is 25,344</p>
            <p>The U.S. Deaths are following a similar pattern with another uptick today to 4.4% resulting in 2,609
                deaths. If the U.S. continues on a similar wave pattern as last week peak deaths for the week will occur
                on Wednesday or Thursday</p>
            <p>Virginia saw a 1.6% drop from the previous day to 4.3% resulting in 623 new cases. no discernable pattern
                has emerged yet in the V.A. reporting numbers. Although the daily new cases still seem to be on average
                trending up. &nbsp;</p>

                Virginia reported cases: 14,339 +5.9%<br />
            </p>
            <p>On par with previous weeks the U.S saw a small increase today to 2.5% resulting in 24,347 new cases, and
                bringing the total number to over 1 million. &nbsp;Interestingly the U.S. is continuing to follow the
                weekly wave of reported new cases we have seen in previous weeks, only differencing in the depth of the
                wave trough.</p>
            <p>The U.S daily death growth rate saw a small uptick as well to 3.7%. Resulting in 2,093 deaths. This
                follows a similar wave like weekly pattern that we are seeing in the reported new cases. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Virginia also saw an uptick in cases bringing the daily growth rate to 5.9% and 801 new cases. The
                largest to date. My initial estimates put the V.A peak at the end of April. However, with the new daily
                numbers on average still showing larger than expected gains I may have to re adjust my prediction model.

            <p>A little good news for the U.S. The nation is continuing its decline from the its highpoint on Friday.
                The U.S. daily growth rate hit 2.3% its lowest to-date. Resulting in 22,379 new cases. The lowest daily
                amount in 27 days.</p>
            <p>The daily death growth rate saw a small uptick of .5% resulting in 1,373 new fatalities. Still continuing
                to trend lower than last week. Now that the daily growth death rate is similar to the new cases growth
                rate the case fatality rate for the U.S. has remained approximately 5.6% for the last 3 days. </p>
            <p>for the 3<sup>rd</sup> day in a row Virginia is continuing on a downward growth trend. Resulting in 568

            <p>This weekend was filled with highs and lows. As expected, the U.S. continued to follow a similar trend as
                the last 2 weeks. We saw growth on Friday 4.1% resulting in 35,794 new cases the most recorded in one
                day.&nbsp; Then a decline on Saturday 3.6% with 32,730 new cases on Sunday we saw the lowest daily
                growth rate of 2.9% with 27,551 new cases. Interestingly, this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> week that showed a
                wave type pattern of reported cases. With lower numbers at the beginning of the week followed by a slow
                increase into the weekend.</p>
            <p>the U.S. daily death growth rate followed similarly with the reported cases. Friday at 3.9% Saturday 3.4%
                and Sunday at 2%. Sunday saw the lowest new deaths in 20 days with 1,122.</p>
            <p>Virginia saw its highest new cases to date on Saturday with a growth rate of 6.7% resulting in 772 new
                cases. Followed by a decline to 4.9% resulting int 604 new cases on Sunday. V.A. is continuing to trend
                ~10 days behind the nation. I estimate by the end of the week we will see peak new cases for
                V.A.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                wave as the last 2 weeks. If this continues, I would expect to see small growth of new cases over the
                weekend with a decline on Monday. On track to see a 1 million reported cases on Tuesday the
                28<sup>th</sup></p>
