            </p>

            <p>A definite pattern has emerged in the new daily cases. as the previous 3 weeks, the beginning of the week
                shows decline then as the week progresses the cases rise. Last week was no different. With a steady rise
                up to the weekend then a decline in new cases. over the last 4 weeks the average daily new cases have
                shown a decline. the data shows we are on the downward side of the curve. However, its much less steep
                than the climb up.</p>
            <p>The U.S. deaths show a similar patter although not as consistent. On Saturday and Sunday, the daily death
                growth rate was lower than the daily new cases growth rate, the first time ever. Resulting in a case
                fatality rate .04% less than Thursday. If this trend remains the U.S. case fatality rate will continue
                to decline.</p>
            <p>Virginia Is still trending upward for new cases. with its largest number of new cases to date on Friday
                (1,055) with only a small decline on Saturday (836) and similar numbers on Sunday (934). Daily growth
                rate has been stuck around 5% for the last 10 days with little movement beyond +- 1%. until the data is
                showing a consistent downward daily growth percentage. Making predications based on the data will be
                difficult. With that said It seems like northern VA could be on the decline while other large cities
                like Richmond are on the rise. I still think mid to end of May for the V.A. peak overall.</p>
            <p>Mid May will be an interesting time for data. This is 14 days after many of the states have started
                opening back up. It will be interesting to see if there is an increase in daily cases/deaths.</p>

                U.S reported cases: 1,065,967 +2.8%<br />

            </p>
            <p>The U.S. saw another slight uptick today to 2.8% resulting in 29,205 new cases. as previous weeks have
                shown I expect to see a slight increase in Fridays and Saturdayâ€™s numbers with a decline in the early
                days of next week. </p>
            <p>the U.S. daily death growth rate declined from the previous day to 3.3% resulting in 2,021 new deaths.
                Overall, the U.S. has seen a decline in the number of deaths in the last 2 weeks. Unfortunately, the
                Case fatality rate continues to rise the U.S. is now at 5.8%.</p>
            <p>Virginia on average new cases is continuing to rise. With 885 new cases the largest to date. Due to the
                extensive measures V.A. has taken stem the spread of the virus. the curve has been flattened. As a
                result, the peek has been pushed back. Based on data alone I believe we are now looking at mid to end of
                May for the VA peak of new cases. </p>

            <p>The U.S. continues its weekly climb up the wave as seen in past weeks.&nbsp; Today with daily growth of
                2.7% resulting in 27,100 new cases. 432 less cases than the same day last week. The weakly average of
                new cases is consistently showing lower than the previous weeks. Previous weeks new cases averages
                starting on April 5<sup>th</sup> 31,078, 29,401, 29,027, and the current week average is 25,344</p>

                bringing the total number to over 1 million. &nbsp;Interestingly the U.S. is continuing to follow the
                weekly wave of reported new cases we have seen in previous weeks, only differencing in the depth of the
                wave trough.</p>
            <p>The U.S daily death growth rate saw a small uptick as well to 3.7%. Resulting in 2,093 deaths. This
                follows a similar wave like weekly pattern that we are seeing in the reported new cases. &nbsp;</p>
            <p>Virginia also saw an uptick in cases bringing the daily growth rate to 5.9% and 801 new cases. The
                largest to date. My initial estimates put the V.A peak at the end of April. However, with the new daily
                numbers on average still showing larger than expected gains I may have to re adjust my prediction model.

            <p>This weekend was filled with highs and lows. As expected, the U.S. continued to follow a similar trend as
                the last 2 weeks. We saw growth on Friday 4.1% resulting in 35,794 new cases the most recorded in one
                day.&nbsp; Then a decline on Saturday 3.6% with 32,730 new cases on Sunday we saw the lowest daily
                growth rate of 2.9% with 27,551 new cases. Interestingly, this is the 3<sup>rd</sup> week that showed a
                wave type pattern of reported cases. With lower numbers at the beginning of the week followed by a slow
                increase into the weekend.</p>
            <p>the U.S. daily death growth rate followed similarly with the reported cases. Friday at 3.9% Saturday 3.4%
                and Sunday at 2%. Sunday saw the lowest new deaths in 20 days with 1,122.</p>
            <p>Virginia saw its highest new cases to date on Saturday with a growth rate of 6.7% resulting in 772 new
                cases. Followed by a decline to 4.9% resulting int 604 new cases on Sunday. V.A. is continuing to trend
                ~10 days behind the nation. I estimate by the end of the week we will see peak new cases for
                V.A.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
